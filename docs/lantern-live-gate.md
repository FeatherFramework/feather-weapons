# Lantern status: Davy supported, Standard retired

Standard Lantern (utility_lantern / WEAPON_MELEE_LANTERN) failed wheel testing,
even with Lasso unequipped, despite matching metadata and native ownership.
It is removed from the active catalog and fresh-install seeds. The old add_lantern.sql
is now a no-op to prevent accidental recreation. Existing carriers are not deleted
or converted. Apply retire_standard_lantern.sql to disable their usable definition.
An old saved equipment assignment is rejected and cleared by existing restore reconciliation;
the underlying Inventory item remains owned. No automatic Davy replacement or refund.

## Standard Lantern result / separate Davy candidate

Standard Lantern did not appear on either wheel page, even with Lasso unequipped.
Server item 126 remained valid and matched runtime; native ownership was true.
This is not an accepted functional Lantern. Its item/model remain unchanged.
Separate candidate utility_davy_lantern uses WEAPON_MELEE_DAVY_LANTERN.
Unequip Standard Lantern before testing Davy beside one Lasso in the two utility positions.
Supported item setup: sql/add_davy_lantern.sql; grantweapon utility_davy_lantern 2 (current server ID).
Repeat lighting, switching, no consumption, ammo UI exclusion, two restarts and reconnect checks above.
Catalog counts: 43 weapons / 43 ammunition / 38 attachments. Davy live acceptance passed on 2026-10-02.
Tester reported the manual lighting, switching, no-consumption and lifecycle checks passed.

Server metadata confirms Davy item 127, serial FW-LANT-6AC088F1-CB77F4-0001,
in utility_secondary with zero ammo and runtimeMatch=true alongside Reinforced Lasso.
Client confirms both nativeOwned=true and existing throwable pools intact.
Lease checks passed 5/5 (Lasso slot); release checks passed 9/9, 14 active slots.
